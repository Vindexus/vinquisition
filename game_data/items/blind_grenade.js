  description: 'Blind grenades explode with a burst of dense smoke,  IR  bafflers  and  broadband  EMspectrum  chaff,  all  of  which  is  designed  to block detection through the cloud. Sensors and vision that would pierce normal smoke cannot see through haze created by a blind grenade. In calm conditions the cloud of smoke is roughly 3m wide and 2m tall and lasts 3 minutes. In high winds this may be reduced.'
